# Curriculum Overview

### ðŸš§ UNDER CONSTRUCTION ðŸš§

_While mostly finished and usable, parts of this curriculum are under construction, coming soon, or being gently rearranged for best usability._

This curriculum was developed by Emily Fields, Beth Portocarrero, and Mariah Plunkett based on design by Courtney Morgan for the [New York City Public Schools CS4All](http://cs4all.nyc/) course sequence. All lessons, protocols, and other curriculum materials are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International license License: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0. For more info on the limitations and use of materials under this license please click [here](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).

We recommend this curriculum be used as an **advanced** or **capstone** high school course, following two or more years of computer science study in any text-based programming language. This course is a student-directed portfolio builder and students without the experience will struggle to complete work independently.
