# üìÖ Pacing Calendar

The Pacing Calendar is an outline of how you may implement this course throughout a given school year. Please use this Pacing Calendar as a ‚Äúsuggested outline‚Äù and adapt it to fit your school‚Äôs calendar for any given school year and the needs of your students.  For ease, we pretend that there are 4 weeks in each month and acknowledge this is not always true. We also approximated the timing of longer holidays or breaks and know this too may shift from year to year.

We suggest that each project take approximately five weeks to complete - with one week for launch, three weeks for project mode, and a final week for presentations. We also suggest that the Final Project take about three months and can be broken up for students into three MVPs which will each last about a month. While we provide many protocols to help support students with the executive functioning skills necessary for working on a long term project, please feel free to add additional deadlines or expectations that may help support your students.

We also included an optional break for a Midterm Project for teachers that work in schools where midterm projects are an expectation for their classes. Feel free to skip this project if it does not make sense for your students or your school culture.
