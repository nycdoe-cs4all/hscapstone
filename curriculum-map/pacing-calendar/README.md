# ðŸ“… Pacing Calendar

This is a general calendar - and may change from year to year based on school calendar and other considerations.&#x20;

For ease of display, we are acting as if there are 4 weeks per month and realize this is not an exact measure of time. Some weeks may bleed across months, which is also fine - please use each 'week' as a rough measure of 5 days which may not always span Monday - Friday or Monday - Friday in the same month.
