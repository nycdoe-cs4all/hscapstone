# Weekly Plans

_**Please note**_: _These plans do not need to run from a Monday - Friday week, though they can; rather, these ‘weeks’ serve as an outline for the protocols that should be taking place roughly every 5 class periods/meetings during each phase of the project process. Any day may be extended or adapted as needed to help support student progress. (Possible points for extension or adaptation have also been indicated below.)_

## Project Launch Week

At the beginning of every project teachers and students will spend roughly 5 class periods launching, ideating, and planning their projects. A Project Launch Week occurs only once at the beginning of each project. Projects that have thoughtful and thorough planning always have stronger execution. Therefore, teachers should be empowered to extend and adjust Days 3 and 4 as needed if students require more time to plan and ideate - this will only help ensure the long term success of each group.

## Project Mode Week

Once students have entered #ProjectMode the class should run pretty smoothly on its own. Each project will need multiple Project Mode Weeks to be completed and the protocols should be cycled through each week. Think of each Project Mode Week as having a few set components that can be adjusted to fit any given week on the school calendar. (It can be adapted to work for weeks with 5 days all the way down to weeks with only 2 days.) Every Project Mode Week should start the week with a Stand Up and end the week with a Goal Setting protocol, the days in between can and should be adjusted as needed.&#x20;

Below is an outline of what a five-day Project Mode Week might look like for teachers and students. The “Middle Days” of each week will probably look different for each student or group within the class (for example: some groups/students may be participating in a One-On-One with the teacher while others may be working independently or participating in a peer feedback protocol). Please reference each protocol for more detailed guidance on how it might be used and implemented within a classroom setting.\

## Presentation Week

Every project culminates in a Presentation Week which occurs only once at the end of each project. Teachers are always encouraged to invite outside stakeholders and experts to participate in this event - outside voices increase the “stakes” for students and create authentic opportunities to showcase student learning. As always, days within a Presentation Week may be adapted to meet student and class needs. Some anticipated adaptations include:

* **Combine Day 1 + Day 2** - As students become more proficient at presenting it may not always be necessary for students to have an entire day to prep and another day to practice. In these situations, Day 1 and Day 2 may be combined.
* **Extend Day 3** - Depending on the size of the class, the number of projects, and the length of each class some projects may take more than one day to present. As a result Day 3 may be extended to last more than one day.
* **Combine Day 4 + Day 5 or Eliminate Day 5** - Some teachers may elect to exclude a celebration or may not need the extra Buffer Day at the end of a Presentation Week. As a result, Day 4 and Day 5 may also be combined as needed.
