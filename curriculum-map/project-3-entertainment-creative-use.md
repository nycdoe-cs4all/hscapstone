# Project 3: Entertainment/Creative Use

## Timeline

\~25 Days (5 Weeks)

* 1 Week Ideation/Planning
* 3 Weeks Project Mode
* 1 Week Presentations/Wrap Up

## NYS Computing Standards

Due to the open-ended nature of projects in this course, they have the chance to cover all of the NYS Computational Thinking Standards. This project may especially highlight:

* **9-12.CT.9** Systematically test and refine programs using a range of test cases, based on anticipating common errors and user behavior
* **9-12.CT.10** Collaboratively design and develop a program or computational artifact for a specific audience and create documentation outlining implementation features to inform collaborators and users.

## Project Focus Narrative

Project 3 is the final project with a theme dictated by the teacher, but it is also an opportunity for students to let loose as this project is focused on entertainment/creative use. The project could be a game - based on the web, an application, or in the terminal - or an art piece using libraries such as p5.js/ml5.js or Processing for Java or Python.

The main goal of this project is that the output is something that is fun/entertaining for the user to interact with. What direction that takes is entirely up to the students.

## Texts/Resources
