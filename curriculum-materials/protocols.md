# Protocols Guide

### ðŸš§ UNDER CONSTRUCTION: Editing, Adding, Clarity ðŸš§

_Please note that this guide is in progress - while usable, many sections are being edited, added to, and rearranged to ensure clarity and guidance on best practices._

Below you will find the many protocols we suggest to help support students with the executive functioning skills necessary for working on a long term project. The protocols have been grouped into the three phases of each project - Launch, Project Mode, Presentation - and should be repeated for each of the projects in the course. (Please refer to the [Pacing Calendar ](https://cs4all-icm.gitbook.io/high-school-capstone-computer-science/curriculum-map/pacing-calendar)and [Weekly Plans](https://cs4all-icm.gitbook.io/high-school-capstone-computer-science/curriculum-map/pacing-calendar/weekly-plans) for more complete pacing recommendations.)

\
For ease, recommended days have also been included next to each protocol to provide a sense of timing - however, you should refer back to the full [Weekly Plans](https://cs4all-icm.gitbook.io/high-school-capstone-computer-science/curriculum-map/pacing-calendar/weekly-plans) for more complete details around pacing, and, as always, feel free to adapt as necessary for your class and students. These Protocols and Weekly Plans should serve as a guide for how to structure your projects - we welcome and encourage you to bring in your own protocols and structures to support your students.
