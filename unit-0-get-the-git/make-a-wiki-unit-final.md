# Make a Wiki Unit Final

### Teacher Notes && Overview

This final project is meant as a chance for students to practice with all of their git flow and github skills so far, but it's also a chance to start introducing them to the project and classroom protocols that they will be using on all the large-scale projects throughout the year.

While this is a much shorter project - roughly a week - students should get the full 'project feel' experience, beginning with ideation and ending with mini-project presentations. More information can be found in the 'Protocols' section of this curriculum guide in the left sidebar.

**NB:** _Making this a partner or small group project allows you to expand the scope of the project requirements and will also give students more opportunities to explore branching, merging, and versioning._

### Suggested Duration

\~3-5 Days, depending on individual classroom pacing and needs

### Prompt

Let's combine what you've learned into a project! We are going to use the occasionally viral idea of [3 Minute Presentation Parties](https://www.bustle.com/p/what-are-drink-talk-learn-parties-guests-are-giving-3-minute-presentations-to-each-other-in-the-most-awesome-way-7917688) in which participants create a 3-minute presentation about _anything_ they feel passionately about.&#x20;

Instead of a presentation, you'll create a mini wiki using directories and markdown files. You'll upload the whole thing to a GitHub repo so it can be viewed by others!

As far as the topic goes, the world is your oyster - this could be about your favorite TV show, school culture, the funniest moments of your childhood, your most hated foods, whatever you'd like to write about given the following project requirements.

**Project Requirements:**

1. Project should be housed in a new GitHub repository
2. The ReadMe file should have a loose overview of your topic
3. At least 3 subtopics, each in their own directory. At least two must have subtopics included in _their_ directories.
4. Each directory needs a 'landing page' which will be a markdown file describing that subtopic.

### Example:

Let's say you make a wiki about **Dogs.** Your main page project is just DOGS. Inside that project, you could have three sub directories: Dog Rankings, Herding Dogs, and Toy Dogs. Maybe Dog Rankings just has a single markdown file with the list of dogs, ranked. But Herding and Toy could each have subcategories for specific breeds of dog, again each with their own markdown file.

You may end up with a file system that looks something like this:

**Note:** This is only meant to serve as an example of structure - your project would be explorable and live inside of a GitHub repository.

### Extensions

An easy extension is for students to just make _more_, but consider also having them explore some specifics in Markdown such as adding images or links to make their project more interesting.
