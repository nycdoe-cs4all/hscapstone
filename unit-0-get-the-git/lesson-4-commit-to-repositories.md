# Lesson 4: Commit to Repositories

### Overview

Make github repo, git init, commits, etc.

Include cloning down repos? Does that need to be somewhere separate?

ensure distinguishing between git and github

### Objectives

Students will be able to:

### Suggested Duration

2-3 Days, 45 minutes each

### NYS Computing Standards

* **9-12.DL.4** Independently select advanced digital tools and resources to create, revise, and publish complex digital artifacts or collection of artifacts
* **9-12.DL.5** Transfer knowledge of technology in order to use new and emerging technologies on multiple platforms.

### Vocabulary

### Assessments

**Formative:**

**Summative:**

### Resources

* [Learn GitHub Introduction: Module 3](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-github-introduction) (Codecademy)
* [Learn Git: Introduction](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git-introduction) (Codecademy)
* [Pushing to GitHub from Replit](https://ask.replit.com/t/using-git-to-push-replit-code-to-github/76064) (Tutorial/Resource)

### Do Now (\~3-5 min)

reflect/review/recap??? skill based from markdown? I dont know?

### Code Along: Initialize Your First Repo

code along - create repository. Git init the folder project and/or partner profile project (whichever they don't do together they can do independently)

distinguish that git is the process and github is the platform we are putting things on

FREQUENT reminders that it's okay to not memorize these steps, but need to know to Google/use resources to find them when they forget.

[special consideration if using repl.it](https://ask.replit.com/t/using-git-to-push-replit-code-to-github/76064)

### Independent Practice: Codecademy Review

complete both codecademy tasks - last module of github introduction and the introduction to git to cement understanding

### Task: Make another repo

students commit another project - whichever they didn't commit as part of the codealong

anything to explore track changes....???

### Clone Repo & Spiral Review

explain cloning, purpose, etc.

clone down someone's file maze repo - find the x's.

frame for next lesson - the idea of branching  (use clone to work on new version) OR removing reference (project clone separate from original)

### Wrap Up (\~5 min)
