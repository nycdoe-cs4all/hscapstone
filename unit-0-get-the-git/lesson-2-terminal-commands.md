# Lesson 2: Terminal Commands

### Overview

In this lesson, students learn to use the terminal to navigate a file system. Much of the git work flow will also be taking place in the terminal, and being able to utilize these simple commands will make their lives much easier.

contain basics: `mkdir`, `ls`, `cd`, etc etc

### Objectives

Students will be able to:

Display the image above to your students. Ask them to write down:

* What they _notice_ about this computer
* What looks _familiar_ about this computer
* What might be _missing_ from this computer
* What they _wonder_ about this computer

### Mini Lesson: Introducing the Terminal (\~7 - 10 minutes)

launch via do-now, introduce concept of terminal and typed commands, preview commands students will be using

### Independent Practice: Introduction to Command Line (\~15 - 25 minutes)

[codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/intro-to-the-command-line) practice activity

### Partner Practice: Create a File Warren (\~10 - 15 minutes)

in new project, `mkdir` to create nested files, hide x.md files inside of these (Markdown files)\
\
will eventually push to a repo and students will clone down someone else's in a future lesson to navigate and find files as spiral review

### Wrap Up (\~3-5 minutes)

### Extensions

_While none of these are required, the extensions for this learning activity are game-based - we strongly recommend making them available with students to explore on their own time even if they do not get to them in class, or dedicating an extra day to explore and play if your timeline permits._

* [**Bandit**](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit0.html) is a command line based game - it uses more commands than students are introduced to in this course, so they may need to do some Googling to deepen their learning.
  * **See also,** [**3 Command Line Games**](https://opensource.com/article/19/10/learn-bash-command-line-games)**:** these three similar games (with different interfaces, scenarios, and goals that may appeal at different levels to your students) are also a great way to reinforce and deepen learning. Some require installation and may require prescreening to ensure use is possible in your school setting.
