# Lesson 3: Introduction to Markdown

### Overview

This course is language agnostic, so to find common ground in the curriculum we will be utilizing Markdown in Unit 0. Markdown is useful in that it will also allow students to easily format their project documentation in their readme pages and may prove useful later in their careers!

In this lesson, students will explore the basics of Markdown through a series of tutorials. Please note that Markdown, similar to HTML, is hard to break or have things go wrong - if they're typed incorrectly, the formatting simply won't show as intended.
